# Common issues and solutions

+ **[I am missing (not seeing) a transaction to (in) the GUI (zero balance)](https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/6640/i-am-missing-not-seeing-a-transaction-to-in-the-gui-zero-balance)**
 Your coins are always stored on the blockchain regardless of the device used to access them. There are also several workarounds for this:
  1. You can always use the [ArQmA web wallet] : (https://myarqma.com) to view your balance, conduct transactions. Or, You can use the CLI wallet for your Operating System. Or, You can use the Android/iPhone ArQmA wallet from the GooglePlay App store.
  2. Your blockchain local node copy is probably corrupted somehow. Remove it and redownload it. It's usually stored at C:\users\local\appdata directory or where you specified it. You can delete it and resync to the ArQmA Network. Or, alternatively for a quick, but possibly less privacy secure transaction, you can use a trusted remote-node like node.support.arqma.com:19994. See Node settings under "Settings", then "node" and fill in the remote node settings.
  3. Remove and reinstall the GUI wallet application.  You can also update the wallet application to the latest version overwriting the same directory that it was installed in with Windows.

+ **[Transaction stuck as “pending” in the GUI](https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/6649/transaction-stuck-as-pending-in-the-gui)**

+ **[My GUI feels buggy / freezes all the time](https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/6651/my-gui-feels-buggy-freezes-all-the-time)**
  Tip: Turn off mining on the wallet while using it if you have it enabled. Or free up a core for applications while using your external mining applicatin.
  You can temporarily disable mining by going to the "Advanced" option on the left and select "Mining" here:

  + **[My name contains a special (non-ASCII) character (e.g. é, ø, â, Ö) and I can't create a wallet with the GUI](https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/6823/my-name-contains-a-special-non-ascii-character-e-g-%c3%a9-%c3%b8-%c3%a2-%c3%96-and-i-cant-c)**
+ **[The GUI uses all my bandwidth and I can't browse anymore or use another application that requires internet connection](https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/6653/the-gui-uses-all-my-bandwidth-and-i-cant-browse-anymore-or-use-another-applicat)**
  Remember, your wallet file does not have a file extension. There are actually two or more files for each "wallet" created. The keys file has a .keys file extension. Avoid spaces and non ASCII (only A-Z, 0-9) characters.

Connecting to the node from the GUI wallet
After you enter your password for your wallet, you will see a pop up that will give you the option to "use custom settings". Click on it. You will then be sent to the "Settings > Node" page in the GUI. At this point you could choose 'Remote Node' see four text boxes labeled "Address", "Port", "Daemon username" and "Daemon password". Fill the address of the node that you want to connect to which is node.supportarqma.com port 19994. This address might look like node.supportarqma.com or it could look like any old ip address. Then fill the "Port" box with the node's port. The default port is 19994. Optionnaly, fill the username and password if your remote note requires them.
Your screen should look a bit like this

+ **I use a high resolution display and the GUI looks extremely small**  
This problem will be fixed soon, but there is a workaround for Windows: right click on ArQmA-wallet-gui.exe, select properties --> compatibility. you'll find a 'high DPI' option, change value there from "Application" to "System" or vice versa
