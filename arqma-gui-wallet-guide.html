<h2 id="translations">Translations</h2>
<p>This document will be localized into several languages. You can find all available translations in the <a href="https://github.com/mechanator/ArQmA-GUI-wallet-guide/tree/master/translations">dedicated section on GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2 id="windows-preparation">Windows Preparation</h2>
<p>If you are on Windows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that your antivirus does not block the program. Antivirus program arbitrarily flag most blockchain applications as virii. Add and exeception to your installed antiirus program before proceeding.</li>
</ul>
<p>A miner is included in the ArQmA GUI software and, as a result, most anti virus software flags the ArQmA GUI files as malware and subsequently quarantines them. Fortunately, however, there's a fairly trivial work around you can use. That is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new directory / folder.</li>
<li>Open your AV software.</li>
<li>Add an exception for the newly created directory / folder. Put differently, you have to whitelist the newly created directory / folder.</li>
<li>Extract the .zip file (in case of Windows) or the .tar.bz2 file (in case of Linux or Mac OS X) to the whitelisted directory / folder.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note:</em> if you're using Windows and did not install custom anti virus software, Windows Defender is, most likely, acting as active anti virus software.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first time you start the wallet you must give permission to connect to the network via a pop-up. Check the appropriate boxes and click <code>Allow access</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="media/win-firewall-check.png" alt="win firewall check" /></p>
<h2 id="shortcuts">Shortcuts</h2>
<p>Some shortcuts are available to make the user experience with the GUI easier:  </p>
<p><strong>On all operating systems:</strong><br />
Press <code>Ctrl</code> to view each page shortcut. Press <code>ctrl+&quot;shortcut&quot;</code> to go to that page  </p>
<p><strong>On Linux/Windows:</strong><br />
<code>ctrl + tab</code> -&gt; go to the next page<br />
<code>ctrl + shift + tab</code> -&gt; go to the previous page  </p>
<p><strong>On macOS:</strong><br />
<code>cmd + tab</code> -&gt; go to the next page<br />
<code>cmd + shift + tab</code> -&gt; go to the previous page</p>
<h1 id="welcome">Welcome</h1>
<p><img src="media/wizard_0-welcome.png" alt="Welcome" /></p>
<p>Extract the package and click on <code>ArQmA-wallet-gui</code>.</p>
<p>Welcome to ArQmA GUI Wallet.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Language:</strong> Click here to see a list of available languages.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Continue:</strong> If you are satisfied with the current language, continue to the next screen.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="choose-a-language">Choose a Language</h2>
<p><img src="media/wizard_1-lang.png" alt="Language" /></p>
<p>You'll see a list of available languages, click on the one of your choice to change it and continue from the welcome screen. <em>Note:</em> You will be able to change the language later by clicking on the <em>flag</em> in the upper-left corner.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Close:</strong> Cancel and return to the previous screen.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="choose-wallet-mode">Choose wallet mode</h2>
<p><img src="media/wizard_1_1-mode.png" alt="mode" /></p>
<p>This page lets you choose the mode that best suits your accessibility and privacy needs.<br />
<em>Note:</em> Stagenet and Testnnet only supports <em>Advanced mode</em>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Simple mode:</strong> This mode will connect your wallet to a remote node. Please note that remote nodes may weaken your privacy. Choose this if you have low privacy requirement, need to quickly access the ArQmA network, and only intend to manage small amount of ArQmA.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Simple mode (bootstrap):</strong> This mode is similar to the previous one, as it will connect you to a remote node, but will download the blockchain to your local drive in the background. As soon as you have a local copy of the entire blockchain, you will be connected to your local node. It allows you to start using ArQmA immediately and have a fallback option if your local blockchain needs to sync new blocks while offering the privacy benefits of a full node when fully synced.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Advanced mode:</strong> Using this mode will let you run a full node, which downloads and maintains an entire copy of the blockchain. Your wallet will not be usable until your local copy of the blockchain is fully synchronized. Choose this mode if the maximum privacy matters to you.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Change language:</strong> This will let you choose the language from the startup page (again).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="about-the-simplebootstrap-mode">About the Simple/Bootstrap mode</h2>
<p><img src="media/wizard_1_2-warning.png" alt="acknowledgement" /></p>
<p>Upon choosing simple mode or bootstrap mode, an acknowledgement page will be shown, explaining the features, behavior, and privacy constraints of the mode.<br />
Please carefully read those informations before accepting the implications of this mode and proceed to the next step.<br />
You must understand the inherent risks of using a remote node for your privacy, and you should avoid using it with large amounts of money. If you connect to a <em>malicious</em> remote node, it could track your IP address, your &quot;restore height&quot; and associated block request data, and send you inaccurate information to learn more about transactions you make.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Region:</strong> Choose a region to pick up the remote nodes from. The closer the node is, the better the wallet performance will be.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Acknowledgement:</strong> Check This box if you have <strong>fully understood</strong> the privacy implications of a remote node and agree to <strong>weaken your privacy</strong> by using it.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="create-a-wallet">Create a Wallet</h1>
<p><img src="media/wizard_2-options.png" alt="welcome" /></p>
<p>On this page you can choose how to connect to the wallet and to the network:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Create a new wallet:</strong> Start the procedure to make a new wallet. Choose this option if this is your first time using ArQmA.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Create new wallet from hardware:</strong> Create a new wallet from an hardware device (like Ledger or Trezor)<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Open a wallet from file:</strong> Choose this option to select a pre-existing wallet from your files with the extension <code>.keys</code>.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Restore wallet from keys or mnemonic seed:</strong> Click here if you want to recover a pre-existing wallet using the mnemonic seed or the keys.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Change wallet mode:</strong> Click here to switch between modes and choose the wallet mode that best fits your needs.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Mainnet:</strong> <em>Advanced:</em> Select this from the dropdown list to use the main ArQmA network<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Testnet:</strong> <em>Advanced:</em> Select this from the dropdown list if you would like to use a development network instead of the main network. Testnet is designed to let developers test new features that are not available on Mainnet or Stagenet.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Stagenet:</strong> <em>Advanced:</em> Select this from the dropdown list if you would like to use a network for staging instead of the main network. Stagenet mimics the features of Mainnet and is designed to let end users test ArQmA without the risk of losing funds.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Number of KDF rounds:</strong> <em>Advanced:</em> Adjust the number of Key Derivation Function rounds in order to enhance the overall security of the generated keys. Any random large number will increase the security.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="create-new-wallet">Create new wallet</h2>
<p><img src="media/wizard_3-create.png" alt="new" /></p>
<p>Here you can create a new wallet:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Wallet name:</strong> Give a name for your wallet (in this example <code>testname</code> is used).<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Mnemonic seed: Write down your [mnemonic seed] and keep it safe. Your seed is the master key of your wallet, you can use it to recover your funds.</strong><br />
</li>
<li><strong>Wallet location:</strong> Select the destination folder of the wallet.<br />
</li>
<li>Remember, there is no recovery possible for lost seeds or lost private view/spendkeys. Safeguard it like it was cash. ### Add a password <img src="media/wizard_4-pass.png" alt="add password" /></li>
</ol>
<p>Add a strong password to protect your wallet. If you lose your password, then only your mnemonic seed can recover your wallet.</p>
<h3 id="daemon-settings-advanced-mode">Daemon settings (Advanced mode)</h3>
<p><img src="media/wizard_5-daemon-settings.png" alt="daemon settings" /></p>
<p>Here you can choose if you are going to run a full node or use a remote one:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Start node in background:</strong> Check this box to run a full node and begin blockchain sync.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Blockchain location (optional):</strong> To store the blockchain somewhere other than default, enter that location here.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Bootstrap node:</strong> To use a bootstrap node enter the host and port. A bootstrap node allows you to use your wallet while you are downloading the blockchain by connecting to a remote node. For a list of available remote nodes and info about them, check the <a href="#about-remote-nodes">About remote nodes</a> section of this guide.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Connect to a remote node:</strong> Check this box if you want to use only a remote node without downloading the blockchain. You will need to put the host and port of the remote node after checking the box.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="run-a-full-node">Run a full node</h3>
<p>Upon completion of the setup you will be prompted to the settings menu, but first you will see a window like this pop up:</p>
<p><img src="media/daemon-launch.png" alt="sync" /></p>
<p>If you want to create a normal wallet using your personal full node, you don't need to do anything, let the countdown finish, then wait until your node is fully synced.<br />
If you need some special settings, like setting up a view-only wallet or adding the blockchain manually, go to <a href="#settings">Settings</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><strong>Restore a wallet from device:</strong> Choose this option if you already had a hardware wallet and want to restore it.<br />
<strong>Creation Date or Restore height (optional):</strong> <em>Restore only:</em> If you know the date or block height that your wallet was created at, you can specify it here so the wallet doesn't have to scan the entire blockchain looking for your funds. For example, if your first transaction was included on <code>2017-07-08</code> in block <code>1350000</code>, you should put the previous day date (e.g. <code>2017-07-06</code>) or a slightly lower height (e.g. <code>1330000</code>) so the wallet will start scanning from there, saving you some time. More information about restore height on <a href="https://ArQmA.stackexchange.com/questions/7581/what-is-the-relevance-of-the-restore-height">StackExchange</a>.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Subaddress lookahead (optional):</strong> pregenerate a number of accounts with a number of subaddresses each.<br />

<p>Step by step guide on how to generate a Ledger wallet with the ArQmA GUI for all operating systems (StackExchange):<br />
[How do I generate a Ledger ArQmA wallet with the GUI (ArQmA-wallet-gui)?] This is similar to the ArQmA one here:(https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/9901/how-do-i-generate-a-ledger-monero-wallet-with-the-gui-monero-wallet-gui)</p>
<h3 id="add-a-password">Add a password</h3>
<p><img src="media/wizard_4-pass.png" alt="add password" /></p>
<p>Add a strong password to protect your wallet. If you lose your password, then only your mnemonic seed can recover your wallet. Remember, if you also lose your 25 mnemonic seed, you cannot recover your wallet. There is no further recovery process if you lose both the keys and the mnemonic.</p>

<h3 id="restoring-from-seed">Restoring from seed</h3>
<p><img src="media/wizard_6-restore-seed.png" alt="restore from seed" /></p>
<p>Restoring from your mnemonic seed is the easiest way to recover your wallet. You need to put the following information:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Wallet name:</strong> Give a name for your wallet (in this example <code>testname</code> is used).<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Mnemonic seed:</strong> Paste your seed made of 25 (or 24) words.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Creation Date or Restore height (optional):</strong> If you know the date or block height that your wallet was created at, you can specify it here so the wallet doesn't have to scan the entire blockchain looking for your funds. For example, if your first transaction was included on <code>2018-07-08</code> in block <code>1350000</code>, you should put the previous day date (e.g. <code>2018-07-06</code>) or a slightly lower height (e.g. <code>1330000</code>) so the wallet will start scanning from there, saving you some time.

<h2 id="shared-ringdb">Shared RingDB</h2>
<p><img src="media/black_sharedringdb.png" alt="shared ringdb 1/2" /></p>
<p>This is an advanced tool that can be used to improve the privacy of ring signatures. The outputs used in ring signatures can be adapted to mitigate the privacy loss when using a key-reusing fork or to avoid outputs that could not be spent in this transaction.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Mark as spent filename:</strong> This tool will mark outputs that are known to be spent. After running arqma-blockchain-mark-spent-outputs, import the resulting file to avoid using these outputs as decoys in constructed ring signatures. This file is stored in the .shared-ringdb folder by default.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Mark as spent output:</strong> This will mark or unmark as spent a chosen single output. Outputs are represented by 64-character strings. The outputs added in this field will not be used as decoys in constructed ring signatures. Unmarked outputs may (but will not necessarily) by used as decoys.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="media/black_sharedringdb_2.png" alt="shared ringdb 2/2" /></p>

</li>
<li><strong>Get ring:</strong> Press the &quot;Get Ring&quot; button to get the ring members for the given key image in 3.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Set ring:</strong> Press the &quot;Set Ring&quot; button to set the ring members for a transaction. Copy the ring members from 4 to get those for the key image, or manually type in your own.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Intent to spend:</strong> Select this if you are certain that you will spend ArQmA on a key-reusing fork. This will aggressively modify the input selection algorithm to give you the greatest plausible deniability.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Possibility to spend:</strong> Select this if you may spend ArQmA on a key-reusing fork. This will modify the input selection algorithm. Uncheck this only if you are certain you will not use a key-reusing fork.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Relative:</strong> When selected, the offsets are encoded relative to the previous, as opposed to absolute (transactions use relative offsets).<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Segregation height:</strong> The block height at which the key-reusing fork splits.</li>

</li>
<li><strong>Public spend key:</strong> The public spend key is used by the network to verify the signature of the key image you generate when you make a transaction. This is what prevents double-spends as the network enforces the rule that a key image can be spent only once. <em>Learn more about ArQmA <a href="https://getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/spendkey.html">spend keys</a>.</em></li>

Just use the ArQma signing key instead of fluffypony's key to verify the checksum/signing of ArQmA releases here: (https://github.com/arqma/arqma-gui/releases) You can see the SHA-256 keys each release per Operating System.</p>
<h1 id="about-remote-nodes">About remote nodes</h1>
<p>Remote nodes are useful if you are not able/don't want to download the whole blockchain, but be advised that malicious remote nodes could compromise some privacy. They may track your IP address, track your &quot;restore height&quot; and associated block request data, and send you inaccurate information to learn more about transactions you make. Please make sure to use a node you trust (hopefully your own) and remain aware of these limitations. Users who prioritize privacy should use a full node instead. A number of trusted ArQmA open nodes are at node.supportarqma.com:19994 . Which is maintained by several auto global rollover IPs closest to your locality.</p>
<h2 id="bootstrap-nodes">Bootstrap nodes</h2>
<p>A bootstrap node is a remote node to use whilst also syncing the blockchain. This is different than the remote node setting, since it will only use the specified remote node until the blockchain is fully synced locally. It is a reasonable tradeoff for most people who care about privacy but also want the convenience of an automatic fallback option. Be aware that when using remote nodes (including with the bootstrap setting), nodes may track your IP address, track your &quot;restore height&quot; and associated block request data, and send you inaccurate information to learn more about transactions you make. Please make sure to use a node you trust (hopefully your own) and remain aware of these limitations. Keep the ArQmA full node software operating on your computer even when you are not using the wallet to reduce the amount of leaked data. Use the ArQmA trusted node at node.supportarqma.com:19994 .</p>

There are also several workarounds for this:</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>You can always use the [ArQmA web wallet] : (https://myarqma.com) to view your balance, conduct transactions. Or, You can use the CLI wallet for your Operating System. Or, You can use the Android/iPhone ArQmA wallet from the GooglePlay App store.</li>
<li>Your blockchain local node copy is probably corrupted somehow. Remove it and redownload it. It's usually stored at C:directory or where you specified it. You can delete it and resync to the ArQmA Network. Or, alternatively for a quick, but possibly less privacy secure transaction, you can use a trusted remote-node like node.support.arqma.com:19994. See Node settings under &quot;Settings&quot;, then &quot;node&quot; and fill in the remote node settings.</li>
<li>Remove and reinstall the GUI wallet application. You can also update the wallet application to the latest version overwriting the same directory that it was installed in with Windows.</li>

<li><p>**[I am using remote node, but the GUI still syncs blockchain? Connecting to the node from the GUI wallet After you enter your password for your wallet, you will see a pop up that will give you the option to &quot;use custom settings&quot;. Click on it. You will then be sent to the &quot;Settings &gt; Node&quot; page in the GUI. At this point you could choose 'Remote Node' see four text boxes labeled &quot;Address&quot;, &quot;Port&quot;, &quot;Daemon username&quot; and &quot;Daemon password&quot;. Fill the address of the node that you want to connect to which is node.supportarqma.com port 19994. This address might look like node.supportarqma.com, or it could look like any old ip address. Then fill the &quot;Port&quot; box with the node's port. The default port is 19994. Optionnaly, fill the username and password if your remote note requires them. It is recommended by the developers for safety to just us node.supportarqma.com. Your screen should look a bit like this <a href="media/remote_node_settings.png">mode</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>I use a high resolution display and the GUI looks extremely small</strong><br />
This problem will be fixed soon, but there is a workaround for Windows: right click on ArQmA-wallet-gui.exe, select properties --&gt; compatibility. you'll find a 'high DPI' option, change value there from &quot;Application&quot; to &quot;System&quot; or vice versa</p></li>
